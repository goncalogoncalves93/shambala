knowledge repository 

Greetings from Porto, Portugal.

My name is Gon√ßalo and I created this repository as a task for an online course into HTML, CCS and Javascript. I'm almost finishing my degree in Cardiopneumonology, however I've always had an interest in software engineering, app development, web design, business and operations management, leadership skills and others. 
I'm also into fitness, I workout 5/6 times a week with a moderately strict diet because it is very important on my overall well-being.
